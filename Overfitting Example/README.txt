Run the provided code (overtrainingScript.m) to train MLPs with increasing numbers of neurons (complexity).

1) Make a plot of error on the training set vs. number of neurons and a plot of error on the testing set vs. number of neurons.
2) Modify training code to include either jitter or weight decay. Run again and repeat (1).

Note: The plots that are already generated by the script show the training points (x's), the test points (filled circles), 
and the mapping (solid line) learned by the MLP for each specified number of neurons to use (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32).  The title
off each plot includes the squared error on both the training set and test set. In this example, we are not using the MLP for 
classification, but for regression.
